<head>My first website to make and i'm super excited</head>
<body>My name is <i>Jacob Isabirye</i> a student of <b>Makerere University jinja Campus</b>
I am doing a diploma in ICT, first year first semester.
The course is going to take two years then I graduate.
And I am preparing to do my exams next month.
My goal is to get the following results;</body>

<body>•	Instructions are executed in sequence, second instruction follows the first, and so on.
•	Arithmetic, logic, and data movement instructions follow this criteria.
•	Another type of instruction, control instruction, changes sequence of instruction execution.
•	Control instructions change PC, (Instruction Pointer register EIP on 32-bit Intel x86 platforms) during the Execute Phase of the Instruction Cycle.
•	New value for PC is obtained during Fetch Phase from the instruction operand.
•	As soon as new instructions cycle begins, next instruction to fetch will be obtained at the new PC address. </body>

<h3>ASSIGNMENT 01</h3>
<h4>COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE</h4>
<h5>MODULE CREDIT: 4CU</h5>
<h6>Name: Isabirye Jacob</h6>
<br>

1.	Differentiate between Harvard and Von-Neumann Architecture
The Harvard architecture is a computer architecture with separate storage and signal pathways for instructions and data. It contrasts with the von Neumann architecture, where program instructions and data share the same memory and pathways.
<br>
2.	What is instruction?
An instruction is an order given to a computer processor by a computer program. In assembler language, a macro instruction is one that, during processing by the assembler program, expands to become multiple instructions (based on a previously coded macro definition).
Explain instruction cycle with a diagram





3.	What s data processing?
This is the transformation of data into information that takes place the central processing unit of a computer.

<br>



Explain types of data processing
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4.	Write short notes on:
<br>
(a)	Cache memory
Cache memory is a chip-based computer component that makes retrieving data from the computer's memory more efficient. It acts as a temporary storage area memory.
<br>
(b)	RAM
Random Access Memory
This is the type of memory that stores information for a short period of time (Temporarily). It also holds instructions for the computer, its programs and data. It can be read and written, volatile. It makes the computer run faster if it’s installed in bigger volumes for example 10GB of RAM.
<br>
(c)	ROM
Read Only Memory
This is the type of memory that stores information for a long period of time (Permanently). It is built memory of a computer. It is nonvolatile memory because it never loses its contents. This type of memory lets you store the data needed to start up or boot the computer.
<br>
(d)	Interrupt
These are signals sent to the Central Processing Unit by external devices, normally input and output devices. They tell the Central Processing Unit to stop its current activities and execute the appropriate part of the operating system. Hardware Interrupts are generated by hardware devices to signal that they need some attention from the Operation System.
